        let client = OllamaClient::new();
        let response = client.create_assistant(
            enhanced_system_prompt,
            "enhanced-personal-assistant"
        ).await?;
        
        Ok(response)
    }
}
```

### Recommended Tests

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;
    
    #[tokio::test]
    async fn test_enhanced_features_integration() {
        let agent = CreateAssistantAgent::new();
        
        // Test quick research
        let research_result = agent.process_quick_research(
            "What are the benefits of vitamin D?"
        ).await;
        assert!(research_result.is_ok());
        
        // Test word assistance
        let word_result = agent.process_word_assistance(
            "definitivamente", 
            WordAction::Spell
        ).await;
        assert!(word_result.is_ok());
        
        // Test unit conversion  
        let conversion_result = agent.process_unit_conversion(
            100.0, 
            "km", 
            "miles"
        ).await;
        assert!(conversion_result.is_ok());
        
        // Test math calculation
        let math_result = agent.process_math_calculation(
            "15% of 850"
        ).await;
        assert!(math_result.is_ok());
    }
}
```

### Implementation Considerations

1. **Data Accuracy**: Ensure conversions and calculations are precise
2. **Input Validation**: Verify input formats to prevent errors
3. **Language Support**: Support Portuguese and English for word assistance
4. **Usage Context**: Adapt responses to user request context
5. **Performance**: Optimize for quick responses in simple queries
