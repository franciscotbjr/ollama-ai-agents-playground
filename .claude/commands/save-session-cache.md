# Cache Project Context

I'll analyze and remember key information about this Rust project to speed up future commands.

I'll detect and remember:

    Cargo build configuration and dependencies
    How to run tests (cargo test)
    What formatter is configured (rustfmt)
    Project structure patterns (src/, spec/ directories)
    Ollama API integration patterns
    Agent implementation patterns
    To write development notes and progress in DEV_NOTES.md to keep track of what I've done

This helps other commands run faster by not re-analyzing the same information repeatedly.

<parameter name="command">powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File powershell_cache_script_permanent.ps1</parameter>
