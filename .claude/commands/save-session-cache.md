# Cache Project Context

I'll analyze and remember key information about this Rust project to speed up future commands.

Let me examine your project structure and save what I discover:

**Option 1: Windows PowerShell (Recommended)**
```powershell
# Windows PowerShell - Execute directly
$CACHE_DIR = "$env:USERPROFILE\.claude\.ollama-ai-agents-playground_cache"
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $CACHE_DIR -Force | Out-Null
$currentPath = (Get-Location).Path
$PROJECT_HASH = (([System.Security.Cryptography.MD5]::Create().ComputeHash([System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetBytes($currentPath)) | ForEach-Object { $_.ToString("x2") }) -join "").Substring(0,8)
$CACHE_FILE = "$CACHE_DIR\project_$PROJECT_HASH.cache"
Write-Host "ðŸ’¾ Cache location: $CACHE_FILE"
Write-Host "âœ… PowerShell cache script executed successfully"
```

**Option 2: Unix/Linux/macOS Bash**
```bash
# Unix/Linux/macOS - Execute directly  
CACHE_DIR="$HOME/.claude/.ollama-ai-agents-playground_cache"
mkdir -p "$CACHE_DIR"
currentPath=$(pwd)
PROJECT_HASH=$(echo -n "$currentPath" | md5sum | cut -c1-8)
CACHE_FILE="$CACHE_DIR/project_$PROJECT_HASH.cache"
echo "ðŸ’¾ Cache location: $CACHE_FILE"
echo "âœ… Unix cache script executed successfully"
```

**Option 3: Cross-platform (Separate Commands)**
```bash
# Step 1: Detect environment
command -v powershell >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo "PowerShell detected - use Option 1" || echo "Unix detected - use Option 2"
```

I'll detect and remember:
- Cargo build configuration and dependencies
- How to run tests (cargo test)
- What formatter is configured (rustfmt)
- Project structure patterns (src/, spec/ directories)
- Ollama API integration patterns
- Agent implementation patterns
- To write development notes and progress in `DEV_NOTES.md` to keep track of what I've done

This helps other commands run faster by not re-analyzing the same information repeatedly.

The cache expires after 24 hours or when key project files (Cargo.toml, config.toml, spec files) change.
